# Portfolio-of-holding
Portfolio containing links to my deployed applications

A page made to house and show off all of the projects i have completed/applications I have developed. This will be an ever changing page as I continue to both improve my skills and complete more applications. Building my first page entirely from scratch was a bit daunting. The orientation of elements on the page and getting everything where I wanted it was my greatest task. The HTML itself was simple enough, and linking pages to images was no problem. I hope to revisit this site not just to add more applications, but to apply new knowledge I gain to make the site more appealing and user-friendly.
